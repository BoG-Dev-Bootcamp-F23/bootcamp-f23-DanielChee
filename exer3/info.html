                <div class="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2><img src="images/crc.png"><br>In the not-so-distant future, Georgia Tech faced an unimaginable crisis. It all began innocently enoughâ€”a mysterious virus emerged from the depths of the CRC bathrooms, a place already notorious for harboring all sorts of unexplained lifeforms. What seemed like a run-of-the-mill infection soon spiraled into chaos, transforming 9 in 10 students into ravenous zombies. In a campus once known for its innovation and intellect, survival instincts now reign supreme. The library is now home to eerily silent, studious zombies, while Tech Green sees daily battles of humans versus the caffeine-deprived undead. Now, you have no choice: Survive or become one of the zombies. What can you do?</div>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="hive"><h2>The Hive</h2><img src="images/hive.jpg"><br>Nestled within the confines of the Hive Makerspace at Georgia Tech lies an unexpected stronghold against the encroaching zombie menace. With an arsenal of tools and boundless creativity, survivors have harnessed the Hive's potential to devise ingenious means of defense. The whir of 3D printers fabricates customized barricades, transforming plastic filaments into formidable shields. Robotics enthusiasts retrofit drones into aerial scouts, gathering critical intelligence on undead movements. Pyrotechnic experiments yield Molotov cocktails for fiery deterrents. In the heart of the Hive, innovation thrives amidst adversity, offering survivors the power to repurpose, adapt, and reclaim their Georgia Tech grounds in the face of the relentless undead horde.</div>
                    <div class="stinger"><h2>Stingers</h2><img src="images/stinger.png"><br>Within the dystopian landscape of Georgia Tech's zombie-ridden campus, Stingers have transformed into mobile strongholds. Harnessing the Hive Makerspace's resources, survivors outfit these buses with defensive innovations. Steel blades, once for woodworking, now protect the exteriors. Aluminum scrap metal become shields, and makeshift weaponry adorns the sides, transforming buses into rolling zombie defenses. The buses, no longer just for transportation, navigate Georgia Tech's perilous terrain, becoming both guardians of survival and safe-havens for architecture students who still have to go to the studio to finish their projects.</div>
                    <div class="climb"><h2>Rock Climbing Wall</h2><img src="images/wall.png"><br>Amidst the Georgia Tech chaos, the rock climbing wall within the CRC emerges as an unconventional haven against the relentless zombie threat. As students scramble for safety, climbers ascend the wall with newfound purpose. Scaling the heights, they find refuge at the summit, shielded from the encroaching undead by sheer verticality. Perched at the pinnacle, survivors enjoy a high-ground advantage, surveying the campus below and strategizing with an unparalleled vantage point. With nimbleness and resourcefulness, the rock climbing wall becomes both sanctuary and stronghold, offering respite and a tactical edge in the ongoing survival saga at Georgia Tech.</div>
                    <div class="hole"><h2>Pot Holes</h2><img src="images/pothole.png"><br>Navigating the perilous terrain of a zombie-infested Georgia Tech campus demands resourcefulness. Potholes, as ubiquitous on campus as CS majors with intel threads, evolve into cunning traps for the undead menace. Survivors ingeniously repurpose these craters, camouflaging them to blend with the terrain. Zombie hordes, lumbering relentlessly, fall victim to these deceptive pits. Disguised by debris and foliage, the potholes conceal pitfalls lined with spikes and other obstacles. With patience and strategy, survivors lure the undead into their unwitting doom. Potholes transform into essential components of campus defense, offering a crafty means of thinning the relentless zombie ranks and preserving safety amidst the chaos.</div>
                </div> 
                <div class="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2><img src="images/sky.png"><br>From repurposing tools at the Hive to transforming Stingers into mobile fortresses, and even using deep potholes as devious traps, we stand ready to face the undead horde with resilience and wit. As we hold out hope for a few more months, at which the zombies start to leave Atlanta for their summer internships, we'll use every resource, every innovation, and every worthy strategy to stay alive. In this battle, creativity, adaptability, and camaraderie will be our greatest assets. Stay safe, survivors, for our escape from Atlanta may yet be within reach!</div>
